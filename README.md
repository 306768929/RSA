# Simple RSA encryption/decryption with Java (GUI)

Since we're studying discrete mathematics in school, and currently reading about modular mathematics and RSA encryption, I thought it would be a nice exercise to whip something up in Java. I didn't want to take advantage of the various built in keypair generators in the JDK, but used a couple of handy methods in the `BigInteger` class instead.

Nothing fancy. Works only with integers, for the time being.
